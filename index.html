    <h2>What is Andro.js?</h2>

    <p>
      Andro.js takes mixins and applies them, each in its own namespace, to an object, and lets them talk to one other via an event emitter.
    </p>

    <h3>Come again?</h3>
      Imagine a cube.  It can be touched.  You want this cube to make a sound when it goes from not being touched to being touched.  You write a little behaviour that emits an event when a first touch occurs.  You write another little behaviour that plays a sound when it receives a first touch event.  You combine these behaviours on your cube with Andro.js.
    <p>

    <p>
      Or, to put it another way, Andro.js a library for objects that can't quite decide who they are.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>Um, may I see an example?</h3>

    <p>
      I require the <code>andro.js</code> file.  I instantiate <code>Andro</code>.  I define a <code>Cube</code> constructor with a <code>touch</code> function.  When this <code>touch</code> function is called, it emits a <code>touch</code> event to all behaviours attached to the cube.
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var Andro = require('andro').Andro;
  var andro = new Andro();

  function Cube {
    this.touch = function(contact) {
      andro.eventer(this).emit("touch", contact);
    };
  };
</pre>

    <p>
      I define <code>firstTouchBehaviour</code>.  This binds to the <code>touch</code> events emitted by its owner and keeps track of the number of things currently in contact.  When the owner goes from being untouched to being touched, <code>firstTouchBehaviour</code> emits a <code>FirstTouch:newlyBeingTouched</code> event.
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var firstTouchBehaviour = {
    touchCount: 0,

    setup: function(owner) {
      andro.eventer(owner).bind(this, "touch", function(contact) {
        if(contact === "added") {
          if(this.touchCount === 0) {
            andro.eventer(owner).emit("FirstTouch:newlyBeingTouched");
          }
          this.touchCount++;
        } else if(contact === "removed") {
          this.touchCount--;
        }
      });
    }
  };
</pre>

    <p>
      I define <code>soundBehaviour</code>.  This binds to the <code>FirstTouch:newlyBeingTouched</code> event.  Each time this event occurs, <code>soundBehaviour</code> makes a noise: "Rarrrrrwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww".
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var soundBehaviour = {
    setup: function(owner) {
      andro.eventer(owner).bind(this, "FirstTouch:newlyBeingTouched", function() {
        console.log("Rarrrrrwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww");
      });
    }
  };
</pre>

    <p>
      I now put everything together.  I instantiate <code>cube</code>, set it up for use with Andro.js and augment it with <code>firstTouchBehaviour</code> and <code>soundBehaviour</code>.  Finally, I simulate two touches upon the cube.  On the first, it roars.  On the second, it does not.
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var cube = new Cube();
  andro.setupOwner(cube);
  andro.augmentOwner(cube, firstTouchBehaviour);
  andro.augmentOwner(cube, soundBehaviour);

  cube.touch("added"); // rarrrww
  cube.touch("added"); // silence
</pre>

    <h2>Why is this cool?</h2>

    <p>
      Behaviours are completely separate from each other, so they are reusable.  You could write <code>explodeBehaviour</code>, combine it with <code>firstTouchBehaviour</code> and have exploding cubes.  Or you could write <code>wetBehaviour</code>, combine it with explodey and touchey and have depth charges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Behaviour mixins are good for writing video games.  They help with the concoction of game object logic: no more nightmarish inheritance hierarchies or weird bundles of functions that invent cryptic interfaces for the objects upon which they operate.
    </p>

      See <a href="#notcool">the end of this document</a> for why Andro.js might not be cool.
    </p>

    <h2>Reference</h2>

    <h3>Set up an owner object</h3>

    <p>
      We call <code>setupOwner()</code>, passing in an owner object.  This adds a <code>behaviours</code> property that will hold the behaviour objects that augment the owner.  It also adds a <code>behaviours.eventer</code> property that holds the event emitter.
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var andro = new Andro();

  var ownerObject = {};
  andro.setupOwner(ownerObject);
</pre>

    <h3>Add a behaviour to an owner object</h3>
    <p>
      A behaviour is a JavaScript object that has some properties and functions.  It can be an empty object, if you like.  Here is a behaviour that is not an empty object, but still does absolutely nothing:
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var wooBehaviour = {
    setup: function(owner, settings) {
      this.owner = owner;
    }
  };
</pre>
    <p>
      We add this behaviour to the owner object by calling <code>augmentOwner()</code> and passing in <code>ownerObject</code>, <code>wooBehaviour</code> and an optional <code>settings</code> object.  This creates a behaviour object, adds it to the <code>ownerObject.behaviours</code> array and writes the properties and functions of the behaviour to it.
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var andro = new Andro();

  var ownerObject = {};
  andro.setupOwner(ownerObject);
  andro.augmentOwner(ownerObject, wooBehaviour, {
    followUp: "hoo"
  });
</pre>

    <p>
      <code>wooBehaviour</code> includes the optional function, <code>setup()</code>, that will automatically be run when we call <code>augmentOwner()</code>.  When it is run, <code>setup()</code> receives an <code>owner</code> argument that is bound to the owner of the behaviour, and the optional <code>settings</code> object, if one was passed to <code>augmentOwner()</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Bind a behaviour to an event</h3>

    <p>
      We can improve the version of <code>wooBehaviour</code> from the previous section so that, when it receives an event, <code>woo</code>, it goes "woo":
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var wooBehaviour = {
    setup: function(owner, settings) {
      this.owner = owner;
      andro.eventer(owner).bind(this, "woo", function() {
        console.log("Woo.");
      });
    }
  };
</pre>

    <p>
      A reference to the event emitter was obtained by calling <code>eventer()</code> and passing in the owner object.  The <code>setup()</code> function now calls <code>bind</code>, passing the behaviour, event name and a callback.  Now, whenever the event, <code>woo</code>, is emitted, our behaviour will go, "woo".
    </p>

    <h3>Emit events from a behaviour</h3>

    <p>
      We can further improve the <code>wooBehaviour</code> from the previous section.  As well as going "woo", it will emit an event, <code>hoo</code>.
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var wooBehaviour = {
    setup: function(owner, settings) {
      this.owner = owner;
      this.followUp = settings.followUp;
      andro.eventer(owner).bind(this, "woo", this.woo);
    },

    woo: function() {
      console.log("Woo.");
      andro.eventer(this.owner).emit(this.followUp, "Woo");
    }
  };
</pre>

    <p>
      We called <code>eventer()</code> to get the event emitter and used it to emit the <code>hoo</code> event that was passed in via <code>settings</code>.  We sent along an identifying string, <code>Woo</code>, as data.  That way, anyone who binds to the <code>hoo</code> event will know who is doing the hooing.
    </p>

    <h3>Unbind a behaviour from an event</h3>

    <p>
      Let's say we become worried that we are going a bit mental with the wooing.  We can alter our behaviour so that, after wooing once, it unbinds from the <code>woo</code> event, thus cutting out any future woos.
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  woo: function() {
    console.log("Woo.");
    andro.eventer(this.owner).emit(this.followUp, "Woo");
    andro.eventer(this.owner).unbind(this, "woo");
  }
</pre>

    <p>
      See how on line four it gets the eventer, calls unbind, and passes in the behaviour and the event to unbind from?
    </p>

    <h3>Export from a behaviour</h3>

    <p>
      To gild the lily, we will make <code>wooBehaviour</code> respond to enquiries about whether "woo" has been said.  To do this, we add an attribute called <code>hasWooed</code> and alter the <code>woo</code> function to set <code>hasWooed</code> to <code>true</code>.  We add a function, <code>getHasWooed()</code>, that returns <code>hasWooed</code>.  Finally, we alter <code>setup()</code> so that it returns an object that includes <code>getHasWooed</code>.  This function will get written onto the owner object so it can be used by the owner itself, or by other objects.
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var wooBehaviour = {
    hasWooed: false,

    setup: function(owner, settings) {
      this.owner = owner;
      this.followUp = settings.followUp;
      andro.eventer(owner).bind(this, "woo", this.woo);

      return {
        "hasWooed": this.hasWooed
      };
    },

    woo: function() {
      console.log("Woo.");
      this.hasWooed = true;
      andro.eventer(this.owner).emit(this.followUp, "Woo");
      andro.eventer(this.owner).unbind(this, "woo");
    },

    getHasWooed: function() {
      return this.hasWooed;
    }
  };
</pre>

    <h2><a name="notcool">Why might this not be cool?</a></h2>

    <p>
      Andro.js contains four modes of expression: mixins, exports, settings and event emitters.  The library protects you from harming your owner objects: behaviours are name-spaced and you cannot give an export the same name as an existing owner attribute.  However, armed with an event emitter and mixins, you can still express yourself into a hell of a mess.  Therefore, I humbly offer you some things that seem to be true more often than not.
    </p>

    <p>
      Status behaviours are good.  That is, behaviours that solely talk about what is going on.  Like, "My owner is longer being touched by anything".</p>
    <p>
      Status-consuming behaviours are also good.  Like, "Every time I hear my owner has been touched, I make a sound."
    </p>
    <p>
      Exported functions that allow the interrogation of state are OK.  Like, "Here you are, owner.  Here is a function that others can use to find out if anything is touching you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Exported functions that allow the state of the owner to be changed are to be used sparingly.  Don't go wild with stuff like, "Owner, here is a function that allows someone to tell you to play a sound."
    </p>
    <p>
      Behaviours that issue orders are bad.  Like, "Every time I hear my owner has been touched, I say, 'make a sound', because there might be a sound-maker hanging around who can handle my order."  This sort of talk is hard to debug because it comprises one behaviour mediating between two others.
