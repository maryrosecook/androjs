Mix behaviours into objects.

## What is Andro.js?

Andro.js takes mixins and applies them, each in its own namespace, to an object, and lets them talk to one another via an event emitter.

## Come again?

Imagine a cube.  It can be touched.  You want it to make a sound when it goes from not being touched to being touched.  You write a little behaviour that emits an event when a first touch occurs.  You write another little behaviour that plays a sound when it receives a first touch event.  You combine these behaviours on your cube with Andro.js.
